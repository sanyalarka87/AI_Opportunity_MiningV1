## Documents

| Document | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **[BRD.md](../BRD.md)** | **Product Requirements Document (PRD).** Product vision, target users, goals, success metrics, module descriptions (Executive Dashboard, Opportunities, AI Segmentation), agent roster, non-functional requirements, roadmap phases, risks, and future enhancements. Start here for *what* we are building and *why*. |
| **[Software-Specification-Document.md](Software-Specification-Document.md)** | **Software Specification (SSD).** Technical design: system context, architecture, technology stack, module specifications, data model, APIs, non-functional requirements, integration, and UX. Includes Mermaid diagrams for context, architecture, multi-agent workflow, opportunity lifecycle, and data flow. Use for *how* the system is designed and for handoff to engineering. |
| **[Implementation-Plan.md](Implementation-Plan.md)** | **Implementation Plan.** Phased delivery aligned to the BRD roadmap: Phase 1 (Executive Dashboard MVP) through Phase 5 (Enterprise Integrations). Covers objectives, success metrics, prerequisites, phase breakdown (goals, deliverables, dependencies, duration, acceptance criteria), milestones, risks and mitigations, and resource/tech alignment. Use for *when* and *in what order* to build. |
| **[To-Do-Activities.md](To-Do-Activities.md)** | **To Do Activities.** Actionable task list for product development. Grouped by roadmap phase (1–5) and by area (setup, backend, UI, agents, integration, cross-cutting). Each item has title, description, priority (P0/P1/P2), and dependency. Use for sprint planning and issue tracking. |
